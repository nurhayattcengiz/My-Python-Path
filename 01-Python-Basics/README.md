# 🐍 Python Basics

This folder includes my fundamental Python exercises covering core concepts such as:

- Variable declarations
- Data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Basic functions and input/output

Each file contains well-commented code in English and reflects practical usage of these concepts.

# File Structure

- `variables.py` – Basic variable creation and assignment
- `data_types.py` – Working with different data types
- `conditions.py` – Simple decision-making using `if/else`
- `loops.py` – Iteration examples with lists and ranges
- `functions.py` – Writing and calling basic functions

> Tip: All examples are beginner-friendly and include inline comments to support understanding.
